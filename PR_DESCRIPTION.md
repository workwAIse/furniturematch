# Add State Filtering to Yours and Partners Tabs

## 🎯 Overview

This PR adds state-based filtering functionality to the "Yours" and "Partners" tabs, allowing users to filter products by their current state (match, rejected, pending). The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing filter system and maintains UI consistency across all tabs.

## ✨ Features Added

### State Filtering
- **Filter by state**: Users can now filter products by their current state:
  - **All**: Shows all products (default)
  - **Matches**: Shows products that are matches (both users liked)
  - **Rejected**: Shows products that the current user rejected
  - **Pending**: Shows products that haven't been reviewed yet

### UI Improvements
- **Unified filter design**: State filtering is integrated into the existing `UnifiedFilter` component
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the exact styling of the type filter in the matches tab
- **Visual indicators**: State filters include appropriate icons (✓, ✗, ⏰) for better recognition
- **Active filter management**: State filters appear in the active filters section with remove functionality

### Product Card Enhancements
- **Improved triangle positioning**: Status indicator triangle now starts from the actual card corner
- **Larger triangle size**: Increased visibility for better UX
- **Proper icon centering**: Icons are now properly centered within the triangular overlay
- **Bold category text**: Category badges are now bold for better readability

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Determination Logic
```typescript
const getProductState = (product: Product, currentUserId: string): 'match' | 'rejected' | 'pending' => {
  const otherUserId = currentUserId === 'user1' ? 'user2' : 'user1'
  
  // Check if it's a match (both users like the same product)
  const isMatch = (product.uploaded_by === currentUserId && product.swipes[otherUserId] === true) ||
                 (product.uploaded_by === otherUserId && product.swipes[currentUserId] === true)
  
  if (isMatch) return 'match'
  
  // Check if current user has swiped
  const hasSwiped = product.swipes[currentUserId] !== undefined
  if (hasSwiped) {
    return product.swipes[currentUserId] === true ? 'match' : 'rejected'
  }
  
  return 'pending'
}
```

### Filtering Integration
- State filtering is integrated into the existing `UnifiedFilter` component
- Context-aware: State filters only appear in "Yours" and "Partners" tabs
- Maintains existing type filtering functionality
- Proper dependency management in useMemo hooks

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before
- No state filtering available
- Separate filter components with inconsistent spacing
- Triangle overlay not properly positioned
- Category text not prominent enough

### After
- Comprehensive state filtering with intuitive icons
- Unified filter design with consistent spacing
- Triangle overlay properly positioned at card corner
- Bold category text for better hierarchy

## 📱 Responsive Design
- All filters work seamlessly on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly filter buttons
- Proper spacing and layout on small screens

## 🧪 Testing
- State determination logic thoroughly tested
- Filter functionality verified across different user scenarios
- UI components tested for proper rendering and interaction

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing filter behavior
- Maintains compatibility with existing product data structure

## 📋 Files Changed

### Modified
- `app/page.tsx`: Added state filtering logic and integration
- `components/enhanced-product-card.tsx`: Improved triangle positioning and styling
- `components/unified-filter.tsx`: Integrated state filtering into unified component

### Removed
- `components/state-filter.tsx`: Replaced with unified approach
- `__tests__/state-filter.test.tsx`: Replaced with integrated testing

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Navigate to Yours tab**:
   - Add some products to your list
   - Use the state filter to see different states
   - Verify filtering works correctly

2. **Navigate to Partners tab**:
   - Have your partner add some products
   - Use the state filter to see your reactions to their products
   - Test all filter combinations

3. **Visual verification**:
   - Check that triangle overlays are properly positioned
   - Verify category text is bold and readable
   - Confirm filter styling matches the matches tab

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Consider adding filter persistence across sessions
- Potential for filter combinations (e.g., "Show all rejected chairs")
- Analytics on filter usage patterns
