## Environment Setup

To enable product scraping functionality, you need to set up the following environment variables:

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

```bash
# Firecrawl API Key for product scraping
# Get your API key from https://firecrawl.dev/
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here

# Optional: Next.js configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Getting a Firecrawl API Key

1. Visit [https://firecrawl.dev/](https://firecrawl.dev/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file

### Troubleshooting Scraping Issues

If you see "Automatic extraction failed" messages:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is set in your environment
2. **Check Console Logs**: Open browser developer tools and look for logs starting with `[EXTRACT_PRODUCT]`, `[FIRECRAWL]`, or `[API:]`
3. **Test URLs**: Try the debug scraper at `/debug-scraper` to test specific URLs
4. **Network Issues**: Some websites may block automated scraping
