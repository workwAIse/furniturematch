# Comments Feature Implementation

## Overview

The comments feature has been successfully implemented for the FurnitureMatch app, allowing users to add, edit, and delete comments on products in the matches view.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Comments Table**: Added to `database-schema.sql`
- **Foreign Key Relationship**: Comments are linked to products via `product_id`
- **User Identification**: Comments include `user_id` field
- **Timestamps**: Automatic `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
- **Indexes**: Optimized for performance with indexes on `product_id`, `user_id`, and `created_at`

### 2. TypeScript Types
- **Comment Interface**: Added to `lib/supabase.ts`
- **DatabaseComment Interface**: Full database representation
- **Type Safety**: Proper typing for all comment operations

### 3. Database Service
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete set of methods in `lib/database.ts`
  - `getComments(productId)`: Fetch comments for a product
  - `addComment(comment)`: Add a new comment
  - `updateComment(commentId, content)`: Edit an existing comment
  - `deleteComment(commentId)`: Delete a comment

### 4. React Component
- **ProductComments Component**: `components/product-comments.tsx`
- **Collapsible Interface**: Comments can be expanded/collapsed
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments update immediately after actions
- **User Permissions**: Users can only edit/delete their own comments
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Time Stamps**: Relative time display (e.g., "2h ago")
- **User Avatars**: Visual identification with emoji avatars

### 5. Integration
- **Matches View**: Comments added to all three tabs (matches, yours, partners)
- **User Context**: Proper user identification and permissions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### 6. Testing
- **Test Page**: `/test-comments` for isolated testing
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/test-comments` for backend testing
- **Build Verification**: TypeScript compilation and Next.js build

## Database Setup Required

The comments feature requires the database schema to be applied to your Supabase database. You need to run the SQL commands from `database-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

### Steps to Set Up Database:

1. **Access Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Run the Schema**
   - Copy the contents of `database-schema.sql`
   - Paste and execute in the SQL Editor
   - This will create the `comments` table with all necessary indexes and policies

3. **Verify Setup**
   - Test the `/api/test-comments` endpoint
   - Should return a successful response with product and comment data

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the "Matches" tab in the app
2. Click "Comments" on any product card
3. Add comments using the input field
4. Edit or delete your own comments using the action buttons
5. View comments from both users in real-time

### For Developers:
1. Import the `ProductComments` component
2. Pass `productId` and `currentUserId` props
3. The component handles all CRUD operations automatically

## Technical Details

### Component Props:
```typescript
interface ProductCommentsProps {
  productId: string
  currentUserId: string
}
```

### Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (user_id IN ('user1', 'user2')),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Features:
- **Cascade Delete**: Comments are automatically deleted when products are removed
- **User Validation**: Only 'user1' and 'user2' are allowed as user IDs
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Created and updated times are managed automatically
- **Row Level Security**: RLS policies are in place for security

## Testing

### Manual Testing:
1. Visit `/test-comments` to test the component in isolation
2. Use `/api/test-comments` to test the backend functionality
3. Test in the main app by adding products and using the comments feature

### Automated Testing:
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Next.js build completes successfully
- All imports and exports are properly typed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the comments feature:
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live comment updates
- **Rich Text**: Support for markdown or rich text formatting
- **File Attachments**: Allow images or files in comments
- **Comment Threading**: Support for replies to comments
- **Notifications**: Alert users when someone comments on their products
- **Comment Moderation**: Admin tools for managing inappropriate comments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Failed to fetch comments"**: Database schema not applied
2. **TypeScript errors**: Ensure all types are properly imported
3. **Permission errors**: Check RLS policies in Supabase
4. **Build failures**: Verify all dependencies are installed

### Solutions:
1. Run the database schema in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Check import statements in affected files
3. Verify Supabase connection and environment variables
4. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to verify setup
